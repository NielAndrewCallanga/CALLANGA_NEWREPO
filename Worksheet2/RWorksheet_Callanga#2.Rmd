#1Create a vector using : operator
  #1.a	Sequence from -5 to 5
  seq <- -5:5
  seq
#Output
  #[1] -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5
  #It will display negative and positive numbers and have a 0 at the center of it.
  
  
  
  #2.a	x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
  x <- 1:7
  x
  #Output
  #[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

#2 Create a vector using seq() function
  #a seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
  #Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
